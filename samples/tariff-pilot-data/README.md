# Tariff Pilot Sample Data

This folder contains a complete counterparty acceptance packet generated by
the `FlexProof.PilotRunner` console application.

## Scenario

- **Depots**: 2 simulated depots (Depot A at 150 kW clip, Depot B at 250 kW clip)
- **Period**: November 2025 (30 days)
- **Optimization**: Peak clipping during tariff peak windows
- **Counterparties**: Energy supplier (tariff negotiation) and asset manager (portfolio assessment)
- **Goal**: Demonstrate that controlled charging reduced peak demand vs baseline

## Files

### Artifacts (5 total)

- `artifact-1.json` -- Depot A peak window compliance
- `artifact-2.json` -- Depot A demand charge delta (historical lookback)
- `artifact-3.json` -- Depot B peak window compliance
- `artifact-4.json` -- Depot B demand charge delta (historical lookback)
- `artifact-5.json` -- Portfolio-level demand charge delta (both depots combined)

### Verification Reports

- `verification-1.json` through `verification-5.json` -- Independent verification
  results for each artifact, including per-check pass/fail status and reason codes.

### Supporting Data

- `tariff-windows.json` -- Weekday peak tariff window definitions
- `audit-trail.json` -- Complete audit trail of all issuance and verification events
- `acceptance-summary.json` -- Summary packet for counterparty review
